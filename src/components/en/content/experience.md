I’m developing the bimago.pl e-commerce platform based on Next.js. I'm responsible for implementing features, optimizing performance (e.g., RSC size optimization), and maintaining the quality of the front-end architecture. I create companion apps, GTM scripts, and integrate external systems (Exponea, eTrusted, Doofinder, Adyen).
