## I'm a web developer by passion and experience

I've been working as a full-stack web developer since 2013. Over the past decade, I've completed dozens of projects — from simple websites and quizzes to advanced product configurators, e-commerce applications, and 2D/3D games.

I've developed applications involving geolocation, Facebook API, integrations with external APIs, and even interactive experiences for entire cinema audiences.

I'm self-taught — my journey took me from jQuery through Angular and AureliaJS to React/Next.js. Today, I work with technologies like React, Node.js, WordPress, Tailwind, GraphQL, and Docker. I'm comfortable working on both the front end and back end, and I see new tools and frameworks as opportunities to grow.

I value pragmatism, clean code, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. I enjoy learning through action and solving real-world problems.
