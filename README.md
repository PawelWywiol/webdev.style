# webdev.style Paweł Wywioł

## I build websites and applications that just work. Well.

Hi! My name is Paweł and I’m an experienced web developer. I create, develop, and maintain modern websites, applications, and web tools — from simple landing pages to complex e-commerce systems and games. I focus on quality, performance, and real value for the user.

## Got a project in mind? I can help you bring it to life

Looking for an experienced web developer who can do more than just "code" — someone who can help turn your ideas into real, working solutions?

I'd be happy to help.

I have over a decade of hands-on experience working with clients and teams — from concept to deployment. I always aim for the best solution: efficient, modern, and purpose-driven.

Whether you need a lightweight landing page, a configurator, a game, or a complex web application — you can count on:

- a collaborative approach and understanding of your business needs,  
- technical support at every stage — from planning to development and maintenance,  
- clean, maintainable code,  
- clear communication and a no-fuss workflow.

Tell me what you're working on — let's see what I can offer.

## I'm a web developer by passion and experience

I've been working as a full-stack web developer since 2013. Over the past decade, I've completed dozens of projects — from simple websites and quizzes to advanced product configurators, e-commerce applications, and 2D/3D games.

I've developed applications involving geolocation, Facebook API, integrations with external APIs, and even interactive experiences for entire cinema audiences.

I'm self-taught — my journey took me from jQuery through Angular and AureliaJS to React/Next.js. Today, I work with technologies like React, Node.js, WordPress, Tailwind, GraphQL, and Docker. I'm comfortable working on both the front end and back end, and I see new tools and frameworks as opportunities to grow.

I value pragmatism, clean code, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. I enjoy learning through action and solving real-world problems.

## After Hours

Outside of work: full-time dad – which builds patience and teaches time management :) When I find a moment, I experiment with microcontrollers (ESP32), retro computers, run a mini homelab, and revisit classic literature (The Hobbit, Saramago) or zombie movies.
